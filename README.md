The anti-bot measures mean that at launch and during trading at all times, bots will be spotted and sniped, as it were, so they cannot buy and sell FEGZILLA. This is an essential part of sustaining a healthy and long term growth pattern. The team has previously worked on numerous other successful projects between them. 3 FEGZILLA is following a trend of successful tokens and is based on one of the most grounded tokens in the whole of the cryptocurrency space: FEG. 
 FEG is the perfect example of a long term project with an engaged community many months after the initial launch. This is the model FEGZILLA are working towards and better, addressing problems older tokens faced like bots both in Telegram and on the chart.

ICO:
There was a private sale followed by a whitelisted presale done privately. The ICO launch went live on Pancakeswap with this raised liquidity. There is a small portion of the supply which will be used for future exchange liquidity. Presale was 160 BNB in total. Max buy of 0.5 BNB and 85% went towards liquidity with a starting market cap of around $250k on Pancakeswap.

ETH Bridge:
ETH bridge will be set up to allow trading of FEGZILLA in ETH as well as BNB. i.e. more liquidity will be available to be traded all round allowing FEGZILLA to surely increase in LP and value. Additional bridges will be set up with FEG being a primary pool. This means FEG holders will have the opportunity to buy FEGZILLA with FEG, directly. FEGZILLA will also be listed on FegEx early on to give exposure to the FEG community and allow for more accessible trading for some.

NFT Market Place:
NFTs are booming in popularity yet they are not properly realised in value by so many, even within the crypto-sphere. Especially with the likes of Meta (Formerly Facebook), NFTs will certainly become a more lucrative asset. The aim of FEGZILLA's NFT marketplace is to provide both an easy and secure way to buy, sell and mint NFTs. Furthermore, it will be a place to add relevance to NFTs by introducing plugins that will allow NFTs to be compatible with partnered games - for example an NFT could be minted by a game developer and act as the key for an exclusive skin within a said game for the holder of the NFT - or services, or even commercial businesses. Think the Metaverse, where physical assets are better realised as digital assets, yet in a much more immersive experience than looking at a screen. The technology that enhances the Metaverse will enhance every NFT... as long as it is ready to use in this new expanding space.
